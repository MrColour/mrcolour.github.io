			I am competent in Python and proficient in C having built various projects from small games, to system
			commands.
			I've have also done a few web projects, such as the website you are on, and willing to learn new tools on
			the job.
		</p>

		<p class="top-sep" style="text-align: center;">
			I participated in a coding bootcamp, <a href="https://www.42.us.org/" class="pink_link">42 Silicon
				Valley</a>.
				The program has a do-it yourself approach where individuals tackle projects and turn them in for peer review
				and automated validation test. The program offers a professional workplace, that is open 24/7,
				where you can meet other like minded individuals working on all tiers of projects. This is where
				I practiced and wrote a lot of C code for various projects, you can check them out <a href="https://github.com/42kmira" class="pink_link">here</a>.
			</p>

		<p class="top-sep" style="text-align: center;">
			Unfortunately the pandemic forced the 42 Silicon Valley campus to close down, with an uncertain date of reopening.
			During this time I began doing coding exercises from sites such as <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/kmira" class="pink_link">HackerRank</a>,
			<a href="https://leetcode.com/kecolour/" class="pink_link">LeetCode</a>, and <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2021/about" class="pink_link">Advent of Code</a>.
			Most of them were done in C, but along the way I practiced and read Python more and more. Not only did these coding exercises boost my skills but they also gave
			me confidence to try more complex projects that had many moving parts.
		</p>

		<p class="top-sep" style="text-align: center;">
			My formal eduction is from <a href="https://www.sjc.edu/" class="pink_link">St John's College</a> from where I have
			a Bachelor's Degree in Liberal Arts. Among the various courses (<a class="warning_text"
				href="https://www.sjc.edu/academic-programs/undergraduate/subjects">source</a>), I studied Math and
			Logic, from Euclid's Elements
			and Faraday's Theory of Electromagnetism to Einstein's Relativity and Lobachevsky non-Euclidean Geometry. I took four years of
			Math, and three of Science where we often read the source material of famous authors.
