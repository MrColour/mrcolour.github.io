# mrcolour.github.io

Better than a github about me page, right?

## ABOUTME.md

I code. I want you to know that I code. I want to show you what I can code. I want you to interact with my code. I want to amaze you with my code.
Check out [mrcolour.tech](http://www.mrcolour.tech) the [website](https://mrcolour.github.io/) I made, hope to impress you and hope you have fun on it.

Heart of the Code,
Kevin Color
