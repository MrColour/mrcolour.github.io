			Better than a Github README page.

			My craft is writing very detailed instructions that change
			ones and zeros; I wanted a stage in which to display my work, this is the solution I came up with:
			a website that shows rather than just says.

			Specify the requirements you want: a website, highly customizable, with full ownership. This meant
			I would have to write my own website, with a minimal layer to serve as the <a
			href="https://github.com/MrColour/mrcolour.github.io" class="pink_link">host</a>, preferably with
			as few constraints as possible.

			Luckily I had a few projects to port and began getting them onto the web. These
			projects were from my <a href="https://github.com/ASSERT-game" class="pink_link">ASSERT_game</a>
			series whose aims was to teach me what goes into making a game, and has me develop the tools
			that would allow me to do so. From rendering pipelines using sprite structs to Xbox controller inputs,
			I tried to create simple but varied projects to grow my expertise in software development and architecture.
			Simple turn based loop in chess, real-time program in flappy bird, input and architecture in pacman, and quality
			assurance in 2048.
			<br>
			<br>
			During this time I brainstormed designs and was beginning to develop the personality I wanted the website to
			have
			through trial and error. The programs above however were not made with the intention of being played through the
			web.
			So I set out to create an applications that would be made with touch input from mobile in mind.

		The next project would take would take all the dedication I had to make. If completed it would be the biggest
		project
		I had made to date. It would involve many different systems working together, a more detailed report
		is found <a href="https://github.com/ASSERT-game" class="pink_link">here</a> if you are curious by what I mean.
		It
		is so far the most complete game I have made and I encourage you to
		<a href="https://mrcolour.github.io/Mympheus/" class="pink_link">play</a> it.
